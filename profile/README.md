wasmCloud is a universal application platform that helps you build and run globally distributed WebAssembly applications on any cloud or edge. Our goal is to make development more joyful and efficient by giving developers the tools to write only the code that mattersâ€”and making it easy to run that code anywhere.

wasmCloud leverages WebAssembly's security, portability, and performance to compose applications from tiny, independent building blocks.These building blocks are managed declaratively and reconfigurable at runtime. You shouldn't need to recompile your whole app to upgrade a database client or patch a vulnerability and you shouldn't need to recompile anything to move your app from development to production.
